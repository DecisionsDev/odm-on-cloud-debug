<h1 class="title topictitle1">Before you start</h1>
<div class="section tutorialDesc longDesc"><p class="p">In this tutorial, you work as a developer for a fictitious loan company. You are currently
working on a decision service that validates loan requests. Called the Loan Validation Service, the
decision service applies several criteria to determine the eligibility of potential borrowers, and
contractual constraints for approved loans. </p>

<p class="p">A business user is reviewing the results of the decision service. The user contacts you to tell
you that the decision service rejects low-risk loans that actually qualify for approval. You must debug the decision service to determine why it rejects the loans. </p>

<p class="p">In <span class="keyword">Rule
Designer</span>, you tag rule
artifacts with breakpoints that stop the running of the decision service at key points. You can then
examine the behavior of the rules in a step-by-step debugging process. You determine where the
errors take place, and track them to specific rules. Then, you modify the rules to fix the
errors.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="sectiontitle">Lessons in this tutorial</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Running the completed decision service</strong><br>You run the completed version of the decision service to see the expected
results.</li>
<li><strong>Task 1: Using automatic exception handling</strong><br>
You import and run the faulty decision service. You find an exception error in a rule,
and try to fix the problem by using automatic exception handling. </li>
<li><strong>Task 2: Setting breakpoints</strong><br>
You set breakpoints to determine where a null pointer exception occurs.</li>
<li><strong>Task 3: Debugging a rule</strong><br>
You set breakpoints in a rule and run a debug session. When you find an error, you make
changes to correct it. </li>
<li><strong>Task 4: Debugging a decision table</strong><br>
You add breakpoints to an action rule and a decision table, and then run a debugging
session to find and fix an error.</li>
<li><strong>Task 5: Debugging a ruleflow</strong><br>
You debug a ruleflow to determine why the decision table does not approve the loan. When
you find the cause, you reorganize the ruleflow to achieve the correct results.</li>
